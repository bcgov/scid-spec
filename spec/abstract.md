## Abstract

A self-certifying identifier (SCID) as defined in this specification is an identifier for, and embedded in.
a JSON object that is created on initial use of that object. The SCID remains consistent as
the object evolves, and is verifiable from the initial JSON object.

SCIDs are using the [Trust DID Web (did:tdw) DID Method].
